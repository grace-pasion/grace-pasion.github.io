## About me

I’m currently a senior at Brigham Young University majoring in Machine Learning with a minor in Mathematics expecting to graduate in April 2026. After graduation, I plan to pursue a Master’s in Computer Science.

I’m focused on strengthening my skills in machine learning and in programming languages including Python, Java, C++, and SQL. I’m passionate about using technology to make a positive impact, and I’m currently working on two different research papers in two different research labs. One of the research papers is focused on improving automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for people with speech impediments, while the other one is focused on measuring moral consistency across stated vs revealed preferences in large language models (LLMs).

### Skills
